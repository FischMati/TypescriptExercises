# Local environment requirements:

* On a mac you have brew installed.
* You have Git installed.
* You have Node JS = 10.18.1 installed (you may have to change your local version to match this one)
(I recommend nvm to change the local node js version)
You have Yarn installed. On mac: npm install yarn -g
You have Visual Studio Code installed.

# TypeScript exercises

To start, run yarn && yarn start in the project folder
localhost:3000 will open. Please wait a bit for the initial render.

The goal: Let everyone play with many different TypeScript features
and get an overview of TypeScript capabilities and principles.

## Things to cover

 1. Basic typing.
 2. Refining types.
 3. Union types.
 4. Merged types.
 5. Generics.
 6. Type declarations.
 7. Module augmentation.
 8. Advanced type mapping.

## To take into account

 1. Avoid using `any` type at all cost.
 2. Difficulty quickly grows one exercise after another.

## How to share my solutions?

### Create a public github repo. 
- Your solutions should be in ".ts" format
- One file for each exercise. 
- The name of each file should contain the exercise number
- Share the repo link with me in whatever way you prefer :) 

### Recommended checkpoints (moments to ask me to review):
* Once after finishing exercise 6
* Once after finishing exercise 10
* For each finished exercise after exercise 10

Feel free to ask me to review whenever you want, these are just my suggestions :)
